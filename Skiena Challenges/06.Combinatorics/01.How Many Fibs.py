How Many Fibs ?

    Inputs:
        The input contains several test cases. Each test case consists of two non-negative integer
        numbers a and b. Input is terminated by a = b = 0. Otherwise, a ≤ b ≤ 10^(100).
        The numbers a and b are given with no superfluous leading zeros.


    Output:
        For each test case output on a single line the number of Fibonacci numbers f_i with
        a ≤ f_i ≤ b
