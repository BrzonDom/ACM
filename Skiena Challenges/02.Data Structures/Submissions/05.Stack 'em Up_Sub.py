Stack 'em Up

    Input:
        The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating the number
        of test cases, followed by a blank line. There is also a blank line between two consecutive
        inputs.
        Each case consists of an integer n â‰¤ 100, the number of shuffles that the dealer knows.
        Then follow n sets of 52 integers, each comprising all the integers from 1 to 52 in some
        order. Within each set of 52 integers, i in position j means that the shuffle moves the
        ith card in the deck to position j.
        Several lines follow, each containing an integer k between 1 and n. These indicate
        that you have observed the dealer applying the kth shuffle given in the input

    Output:
        For each test case, assume the dealer starts with a new deck ordered as described above.
        After all the shuffles had been performed, give the names of the cards in the deck, in
        the new order. The output of two consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line.
