    A sequence of n > 0 integers is called a jolly jumper if the absolute values of the
    differences between successive elements take on all possible values 1 through n − 1.


    Inputs:
        Each line of input contains an integer n < 3, 000 followed by n integers representing the
        sequence.

    Output:
        For each line of input generate a line of output saying “Jolly” or “Not jolly”.


    Sample:

        1 4 2 3
            => Jolly

        1 4 2 -1 6
            => Not Jolly
