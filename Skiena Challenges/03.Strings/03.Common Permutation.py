Common Permutation

        Given two strings a and b, print the longest string x of letters such that there is a
    permutation of x that is a subsequence of a and there is a permutation of x that is a
    subsequence of b.

    Input:
            The input file contains several cases, each case consisting of two consecutive lines. This
        means that lines 1 and 2 are a test case, lines 3 and 4 are another test case, and so on.
        Each line contains one string of lowercase characters, with first line of a pair denoting
        a and the second denoting b. Each string consists of at most 1,000 characters

    Output:
            For each set of input, output a line containing x. If several x satisfy the criteria above,
        choose the first one in alphabetical order


    Sample:
        pretty
        women
        walking
        down
        the
        street
            =>  e
                nw
                et
