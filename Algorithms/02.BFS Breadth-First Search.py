Breadth-First Search (BFS) – Iterative and Recursive Implementation

https://www.techiedelight.com/breadth-first-search/

    Breadth–first search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching
    tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root
    (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a ‘search key’)
    and explores the neighbor nodes first before moving to the next-level neighbors.

    Breadth–first search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores vertices
    in the order of their distance from the source vertex, where distance is
    the minimum length of a path from the source vertex to the node.
