Depth-First Search (DFS) – Iterative and Recursive Implementation

https://www.techiedelight.com/depth-first-search/

    Depth–first search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching
    tree or graph data structures. One starts at the root
    (selecting some arbitrary node as the root for a graph) and
    explore as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
